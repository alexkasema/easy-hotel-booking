## Setting Up the EasyBooking App
This guide will walk you through the process of setting up the MERN Booking App on your local machine.
## Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure you have Node.js installed on your system.

Start by cloning the repository to your local machine:

```bash
  https://github.com/alexkasema/easy-hotel-booking

### JWT_SECRET_KEY

`VITE_API_BASE_URL=`

`VITE_STRIPE_PUB_KEY=`

### VITE_API_BASE_URL

### Frontend:
- Open a new terminal and navigate to the `frontend` directory.
- Install dependencies: `npm install`.
